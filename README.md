### Problems during assignment:

- couldn't figure out how to get query argument from address bar for item.html but found it on namor.
- had to change heroku github from fork to main.
- didn't put form options inside select opener and closer took a while to figure out.
- kept getting CORS error.
- kept getting header error. Fixed it by removing the send after a redirect.
